		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Pull is a third-person action/puzzle-platformer game made by Unreal Engine 4 that narratively takes place in a fantasy dream settings, filled with abundantly clever puzzle-solving sequences, cartoonish-like visual aesthetics and compelling narrative storyline. Distinct elements from other puzzle-platformer (i.e. environment-based interactions) and action (i.e. ability-based gameplay) game genres inspired the development of the game, however providing a slightly different approach to provide a unique gameplay experience. It intends to mainly attract puzzle and/or platform gamers, as well as action gamers who enjoy dynamic gameplay mechanics. There is no specific gender and domain targeted, thus making the game easily accessible and have all gamer types open to enjoy the unique gameplay mechanics.</p>
		<p>For this project I took up the role of the group’s level designer and part of the visual artist. I was responsible for deciding the in-game content as well as part of the 3D models in the game. I used Maya for building our 3D models, which it can directly import the model into Unreal and worked very well. For level building, I used the default building engine in Unreal, which I can easily adjust the models and associate them with the Unreal blueprint.</p>
